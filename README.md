# GCP Container Builder with PHP and Composer

This repo is an example of using [Cloud Container Builder](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/docs/quickstart-gcloud) for automatic builds of a PHP-FPM/Composer/Nginx site hosted in Google Container Engine.

This repo was inspired by the talk "Container management and deployment: from development to production" given at Google Cloud Next '17 by Kelsey Hightower.
